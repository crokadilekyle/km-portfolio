    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>Infact, UI and UX design is really what made me interested in pursuing a career in web development. Since I was a teenager, every job I have held has required me to learn different interfaces to complete certain tasks. I was shocked by the amount of poorly designed interfaces I was forced to use. I was frustrated. I thought, I could do better.</p>
    <p>My goal with all of my design projects is to create the best UI that I can. I believe that the best UI is the one that the user never notices. A user uses an interface to complete a task. A user interface should be intuitive and get out of the way, letting the user complete their tasks with ease and efficiency. </p>
    <p>When I'm not designing for the web, I like to spend time with my family, play the drums, complete woodworking and home repair projects and engage with social media.</p>
